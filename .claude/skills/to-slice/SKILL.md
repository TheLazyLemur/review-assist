Synthesises the conversation rather than interviewing. Not for breaking a slice into tasks (that is to-tasks) and not for a change that needs a full design first (that is tech-spec)."

# To Slice

Turn what has been discussed into a slice. Do not interview the user;
synthesise what you already know.

The terms are in `CONTEXT.md` and the tracker commands are in the `tracker`
skill. This skill is only the part that is not written down there: how to
decide what belongs in a slice, and how to tell whether it is any good.

## Create only the slice

Create the slice issue. Do not edit other slices, tasks, ADRs or `CONTEXT.md`,
however obviously they seem to need it. Say what else you think should change
and let the user decide.

## The slice is thin on purpose

The design lives elsewhere: the domain in `CONTEXT.md`, decisions in
`docs/adr/`, and a larger design in a spec under `.agents/specs/`. The slice
adds only which outcome gets built next, how you will know, and what is still
open.

Point at those documents; never restate them. If part of your draft would
repeat an ADR or a spec, replace it with the reference.

**Use `tech-spec` instead of this skill** when the slice crosses a boundary
nothing has designed yet: a new port, a new platform, a new contract. That
produces a spec, and the slice then points at it. Check before you write: if an
ADR or spec already covers the chunk, a new spec is ceremony.

## Process

1. **Read.** The conversation, anything the user referenced, the ADRs and
   `CONTEXT.md` terms the work touches, and the code it changes.

2. **Name the demo.** One sentence: what can be run at the end that could not be
   run before. If you cannot write it, this is not a slice: say so and stop.

   A demo names a command and its observable result.
   "`review-assist https://bitbucket.org/o/r/pull-requests/3` opens the pull
   request and shows its diff" is a demo. "Bitbucket works" is not. A demo that
   includes the negative case is usually stronger: showing the tool refusing bad
   input proves more than showing the happy path.

3. **Sketch the test seams, and check them with the user before writing.** Where
   will this be tested, at what level? Prefer seams that already exist, and the
   highest one that still catches the bug. Fewer seams is better.

   This step is easy to skip and worth keeping. It is where you find out the
   slice is bigger than it looked.

4. **Create the slice** with the dispatcher. Fill every part:

   ```sh
   .claude/skills/tracker/scripts/tracker.py slice.create \
     --title "Bitbucket pull requests cannot be reviewed" \
     --goal "..." --demo "..." \
     --implements "ADR 0002: ..." --out-of-scope "... (goes to #n)" \
     --open "... Recorded in: a new ADR"
   ```

   - **Goal**: why this slice exists, and what it de-risks.
   - **Demo**: from step 2.
   - **Implements**: the ADRs, spec sections or `CONTEXT.md` terms it builds,
     one line each.
   - **Out of scope**: what a reader would expect here but gets elsewhere. Name
     the slice or issue it goes to.
   - **Open in this slice**: decisions this slice must make that nothing has
     settled. **Each names where its answer will be recorded**: an ADR,
     `CONTEXT.md` or a spec. Never the slice itself: a decision recorded in an
     issue is lost once the slice closes.

   The title is a claim: what is missing or wrong today. Avoid file paths and
   code snippets; they go stale. A type shape that pins a decision is the
   exception.

5. **Stop.** Do not create tasks. Tell the user to run `to-tasks` when ready.
